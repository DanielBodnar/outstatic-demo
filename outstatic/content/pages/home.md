## **Permissions Guidelines on All Print and Audio Material**

To Those Who Would Like to Share Dr. McGee’s Teaching With Others:

We so appreciate your heart to share Dr. McGee’s teaching by bringing as many people as possible the whole Word to the whole world. Dr. McGee’s teaching is copyrighted and *Thru the Bible Radio Network * (*Thru the Bible, *TTB) actively maintains control of any and all physical and digital media that is distributed (e.g., radio, podcasts, websites, apps, CD’s, MP3’s, and any other media available). Dr. McGee did not want his messages edited nor did he want outside unauthorized parties to use his teaching for their own personal profit. He also did not want listeners to become detached from the ministry and its overall goal: to bring the whole Word to the whole world. The further removed the distribution of his teachings gets from the ministry, the less likely people may be to pray for and financially support this mission. We appreciate your heart to help bring Dr. McGee’s teaching to as many people as possible while complying with the desires of Dr. McGee and *Thru the Bible*.

*Thru the Bible* is glad to grant you written permission to share Dr. McGee’s teaching materials, for your work, provided you agree to our guidelines and adhere to any updates in the guidelines as they are amended from time to time. (Use of excerpts for church newsletters, scholarly papers, Bible studies, social media, and the like are granted permission without any further action if they comply with these guidelines.)

**FOR PERMISSION FOR ALL USES BEYOND EXCERPTS:** Send an email to [permissions@ttb.org](mailto:permissions@ttb.org) describing how you intend to use the materials and that you agree to abide by our Permissions Guidelines as amended from time to time.
